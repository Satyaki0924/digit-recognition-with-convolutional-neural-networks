# digit-recognition-with-convolutional-neural-networks
This project recognises digits using convolutional neural network.
It is trained on the MNIST dataset.
I am working on making the recognition custom. This will be updated soon

### This project is configured for Linux and uses python3
To run this project, open up your bash terminal and write
```
chmod -R 777 setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
This will set up the project enviornment for you. This must be run with administrator rights.
After you set up the project, run:
```
python3 run_me.py
```
### The following images should guide you with the rest of the process
